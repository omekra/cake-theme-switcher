# Simple React App with Dark/Light Mode Toggle

## Overview

This project is a simple React-based application that demonstrates code organization, quality, readability, and component decomposition. The app includes a toggle switch for dark/light mode, a button to display a modal, and a two-step modal that interacts with the dark/light mode toggle.
No unit tests added!

## Thought Process

The main goal was to create a clean and maintainable codebase using a React framework. I chose React because of its performance and my familiarity with the framework. The project emphasizes component decomposition to ensure each part of the UI is modular and reusable.

### Styling

For styling, I used tailwindcss. This choice allows for efficient styling and theming, especially for implementing the dark/light mode feature.
